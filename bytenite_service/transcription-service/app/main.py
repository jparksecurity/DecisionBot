# == Main Logic ==

# This is the main function of your app. It will be executed when the job is run.

    # == Your Code ==

    # 1. Reading Inputs
    
    # Read and process the input data from chunk_path.
    # This is a single data chunk from your partitioner, or the full data source file if using a passthrough partitioner.



    # ------------------------

    # 2. Handling Parameters
    
    # Access parameters from the app_params dict.
    # These are the job parameters submitted in the job request under params.app.



    # ------------------------

    # 3. Developing the Core Functionality
    
    # Develop your app's core processing functionality here.


    # ------------------------

    # 4. Saving Outputs
    
    # Save your output files to task_results_dir.
    # These files will be accessible by your assembler or sent to the job's data destination if using a passthrough assembler.
