- JOB_STATE_NEW: The job has been created, and the user may still be updating its data sources and parameters. - JOB_STATE_STARTED: The job has begun execution after passing validation checks, including data sources, parameters, account balance, and grace period. - JOB_STATE_UPLOADING: The job has been retrieved from the partitioner’s job queue and is being sent to the appropriate partitioning engine. Reaching this state confirms the presence of a suitable partitioning engine. - JOB_STATE_PARTITIONING: The partitioning engine processes the job and generates multiple chunks, preparing them for further execution. - JOB_STATE_PARTITIONED: The partitioning engine has successfully divided the job into chunks, forwarding them to the feeder for distribution.

The final result is now prepared for uploading to the specified destination. - JOB_STATE_DOWNLOADING: The final output is being saved to the designated data destination. - JOB_STATE_COMPLETE: The job lifecycle is successfully completed, and the result has been uploaded to the specified destination. - JOB_STATE_FAILED: The job has encountered an error and failed to produce output.
